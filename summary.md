# Admin CMS - Complete Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Admin CMS is a comprehensive, multi-tenant Content Management System built with React, Firebase, and Netlify Functions. This system provides user-isolated blog management with advanced features for content creation, product catalogs, analytics, and file storage. It serves as both a traditional CMS and a headless CMS through its robust public API system. All features listed are fully implemented and tested, making the system production-ready.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and component library
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation with protected routes
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks pattern for authentication and global state
- **Editor**: SimpleMDE for rich Markdown editing with live preview
- **Build Tool**: Vite with path aliases and optimized production builds

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL) with strict security rules for multi-tenant isolation
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with custom claims and role-based access control
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage with user-specific paths and automatic CDN delivery
- **Serverless Functions**: Netlify Functions for admin operations and public APIs
- **API Architecture**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses and CORS support

### Data Structure & Multi-Tenancy
```
Firestore Structure:
users/{userId}/
├── blogs/{blogId}/
│   ├── content/{contentId}     // Blog posts and articles
│   └── products/{productId}    // Product catalog items
├── userSettings/preferences    // User role, permissions, limits
└── appSettings/public         // Public settings (currency, domain)

Global Collections:
├── pageViews/                 // Analytics data with userId/blogId filtering
└── interactions/              // User interaction tracking

Firebase Storage:
users/{userId}/
├── public_images/             // Publicly accessible images
└── private/                   // Private user files
```

## 🔐 Security Model

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Complete Data Separation**: Each user's data is stored in user-specific Firestore subcollections
- **Security Rules**: Comprehensive Firestore and Storage rules prevent cross-user data access
- **API Isolation**: Public APIs include userId and blogId parameters for proper data scoping

### Role-Based Access Control
- **User Roles**: 'user' (default) and 'admin' with different privilege levels
- **Admin Privileges**: User management, role assignment, storage limit configuration
- **Permission Enforcement**: Both client-side and server-side validation of user permissions

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via Firebase Auth (`src/features/auth/LoginPage.jsx`)
2. Auth context provides user data and role information (`src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`)
3. Protected routes verify authentication before rendering dashboard components
4. Admin functions verify user roles via Firebase Admin SDK in Netlify Functions
